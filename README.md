# lab05 -- Create a person

In this lab you will create your very own person class. Basically you will have to create everything from scratch. In this repo you should find a BlueJ package inside `lab05-person-creator`. Go ahead and fork the repo, clone it to your machine, and open up the `PersonCreator` class in BlueJ.

## Create the field variables for the following attributes:

* Name;
* Age;
* Sex;
* Height;
* Weight;
* Social security number;
* Address;
* Phone number;
* Date of birth;

## Create a constructor to initialize an object. The constructor should ask the user for the person's first and last name. 

## Create methods for the user to use that assigns values to each of the object's attributes. Make sure to use conditional statments to insure the user is giving valid information. (I.e. ABC-222-2222 is not good for phone numbers.)

## Create a method that will print all information of object of class `PersonCreator`. (Hint: You might want to look back at the `TicketMachine` class.)
